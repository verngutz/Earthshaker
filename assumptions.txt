List of Assumptions:
1. Distinct suppliers have distinct names.
2. Warehouse staff can no longer add deliveries that were done more than 25 years ago.
3. Warehouse staff do not accept deliveries that the managers are not aware of.
4. There won't be more than 10, 000, 000 entries per table.
5. The sales agents are assumed to sell all items based on the SRP and the corresponding client discounts only.

Limitations:
1. Items are not classified into time pieces, digital cameras and accessories, mobile phones, and small appliances.
2. There is no way to update the system in case items are lost, destroyed, or stolen.
3. Supplier's Names can't have apostrophes.
4. The system can't check if the sales agent is getting a batch for the first time. It has to be manually specified by the warehouse staff.
5. Client discounts cannot be changed.
6. The system doesn't automatically synchronize over the network (pages need are only updated upon loading).
7. Item issuances to the same sales agent on the same day will be tracked as a single issuance even if they are done at different times.
8. Sales agents can't be reassigned to new clients or information about all of the previous transactions between the sales agent to be reassigned and his old client will be corrupted.
